# Cypress Tests

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Node

To begin with the installation of Cypress, ensure that your Node version is `18.x` or `20.x` and above. This requirement is crucial, as outlined in the official documentation [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Nodejs).

#### Linux

For Linux users, it's essential to verify the presence of all the required packages mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Linux-Prerequisites).

#### WSL

If you are using WSL, confirm the installation of an X-Server. A popular choice is [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).

### Setup

1. Check prerequisites, especially Node version.
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
1. Stary Cypress with `npm run cypress:open` or `npx cypress open`.
1. A window will open with the Cypress test runner.
